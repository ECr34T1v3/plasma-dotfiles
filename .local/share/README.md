Shadow-Materia is not yet a complete theme by itself, it is just a small variation of Materia-KDE, so it has the same dependency. 
To install the variation you will need to copy the .local/share files from the dotfiles to the .local/share of your /home/user.

After that, you will apply the following themes in the following order:

1: Materia-KDE on Global Theme
2: Shadow's Materia on Plasma Theme
3: Shadow's Materia on Colors
4: ShadowBreeze on Startup and Shutdown / Splashscreen (Optional)

In the future if I am in the mood I may be able to add a Global Theme to apply all Shadow-Materia components automatically.
